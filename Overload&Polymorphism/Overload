# Let's see the basics of overloading too.

# Python itself performs operator overloading

# With addition we can get different results:
print(2+3)
print("2"+"3")
print([2,]+[3,])

# There's a dunder method called __add__ that we can override
# But we want to overload not override this method

print(p1)

# p1 + p2 = p1.__add__(p2)
# p1 - p2 = p1.__sub__(p2)

print(p1+p2)
print(p1-p2)
